How did you make sure that, if the user runs out of money, you exit the program?
- The only time the user loses money is when he rolls. I have it that at the end
- Checked to see if the user's total is not less than or equal to zero
- Ran a test by hard coding the users money total to $0 if he rolled a draw
- I also harded coded money total to $0 if he loss 

How did you make sure that, after the dice are rolled, the bet re-sets to $10?
- I run three test playing a game with a win, draw, or loss:
- Immediately after each game, I select the print option to see bet total
- I also make sure that they aren't given $10 to bet if they have less than
- $10 after each game

How did you make sure that, if the user enters an invalid menu option, you prompt them again?
- I use different letters, numbers when prompted.
- I also try words that start with valid input letters
- Used repeated letters of valid input

How did you make sure that, if the user enters an invalid bet, you prompt them again?
- tried anything less than 1
- Tested input greater than the amount in the bank

How did you test for winning, both in the case of 7 and in the case of 11?
- Hard coded dice to 4 and 3
- Hard coded dice to 6 and 5

How did you test for losing, in the case of 2, 3, and 12?
- Hard coded dice to 1 and 1
- Hard coded dice to 2 and 1
- Hard coded dice to 6 and 6
